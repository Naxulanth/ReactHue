# [ReactHue](http://naxulanth.github.io/reacthue/)

A web user interface for [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us) lights.

I'm not a big fan of using mobile applications, (especially when I'm on the computer) which is why I built this application to control the lights in my home.

- Remote access: Unfortunately I am unable to implement this as the Hue API has an issue with CORS. This will be done as soon as the API is fixed.
